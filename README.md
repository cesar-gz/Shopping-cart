## Shopping Cart

I ran the PHP through Abyss Web Server X1 and the SQL with MySQL 8.0

I created a web application that you can register an account, save it to the database, then allows you to login to it.
Then you can make a post on a small forum. Browse a shop, select items to add to a cart, and checkout after
seeing the bill total. Then you can logout when you're done.

I used the PHP & MySQL In Easy Steps second edition book from Mike McGrath to help create this application.
